      Scholarship is a boon for students, belonging to the weaker sections of
      the society, who are unable to further their education for some reason or
      the other. Scholarship is an incentive as well as encouragement for
      students, who are talented, but do not have the means to study further.
      There are a variety of scholarships â€“ merit-based, need-based,
      student-specific, career-specific, and college-specific.
